## Content

The folder structure consists on three main sub-folders:

- _**client**_: contains the code corresponding to the frontend of the application, which was developed using the JavaScript library **React**.

- _**server**_: here it is stored the code for the backend of the application, for which the technologies used were mainly **node.js**, **Express** and **MongoDB**.

- _**project-documentation**_: includes a descriptive memory of the project along with a short presentation about it.

### General API Information

All endpoints return a **JSON** object with the following format:

```javascript
// If everything went ok
{
  data: [{...}],
  error: null
}

// In case an error occurs
{
  data: null,
  error: "Error message"
}
```

### HTTP Return Codes

- HTTP `400` return code is used for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
- HTTP `401` return code is used when trying to access a protected endpoint without providing a JWT.
- HTTP `403` return code is used when trying to access a protected endpoint with an invalid JWT.
- HTTP `500` return code is used for internal errors; the issue is on the API side.
